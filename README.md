Project README
==============

Overview
--------

Our project aims to address several critical challenges in the crypto space by offering a crypto mutual fund solution. It allows users to invest in a diversified portfolio of tokens at a fixed investment price, simplifying the investment process. The project also integrates AI to help users optimize their portfolios and manage their wallets, offering personalized recommendations and insights for better decision-making. The integration of OpenAI and Gemini for advanced AI-driven portfolio management is facilitated through the use of the Goat SDK.

Additionally, the integration of a call bot for account management allows users to manage their investments via phone calls, providing an easy and accessible way to interact for those who prefer voice communication.

üöÄ Project Overview
This project consists of three main components:

Frontend: The user interface to manage and monitor your investments.
Call AI Agent: A voice-based interaction system for managing accounts, powered by Twilio.
Rust Smart Contracts: High-performance blockchain contracts for secure, transparent operations.
